# Havi_web

The associated Chrome extension is here
https://github.com/llSourcell/Havi_web_extension

If you want to run the app locally, in the code you will find commented out code that says to uncomment to run locally. Uncomment that code and comment out the heroku code. It's a small snippet. 
Once the heroku bit is commented out and the local code is uncommented, when you run 'node app.js' the app will run locally at localhost:3000

This web app + extension lets you crowdund and claim bounties directly on GitHub. All the back-end logic is in the web app (bounty cron job, database CRUD command (MongoDB), authentication, emailing users, etc.)

The chrome extension displays everything.
