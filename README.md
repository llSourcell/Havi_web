# Havi_web


If you want to run the app locally, in the code you will find commented out code that says to uncomment to run locally. Uncomment that code and comment out the heroku code. It's a small snippet. 
Once the heroku bit is commented out and the local code is uncommented, when you run 'node app.js' the app will run locally at localhost:3000 .
